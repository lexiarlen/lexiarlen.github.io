      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p>
        I care about how science is taught and who feels welcome participating in it.
        My teaching focuses on building intuition, connecting concepts to real systems, and giving students tools
        (often Python) to explore ideas hands-on.

          <h3>Climate + Python short course</h3>
          <p>
            Two-week online course for high school students from around the world. Covered Earth system overview,
            radiation physics, the greenhouse effect, and global climate models. Students coded a simple energy balance
            model in Python.

          <h3>Calculus discussion sections</h3>
          <p>
            Led 20–30 person sections and practiced adapting explanations and pacing to students’ needs.
            Many students were pursuing non-math majors and needed confidence + mastery to reach their goals.

          <h3>Academic mentoring</h3>
          <p>
            Supported students from disadvantaged backgrounds through a matched mentoring program.
            A core goal was changing the narrative from “not a math person” to “I can do this.”

        <h3>What I optimize for</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Conceptual clarity</strong> first, then <strong>technical fluency</strong>, then <strong>independence</strong>.
          I try to (1) define the question, (2) build a physical/mental model, (3) connect it to equations and code,
          and (4) have students produce something tangible: a derivation, a notebook, a plot, a model.
