      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p>
        STEM is for everyone, and I focus on building confidence through intuition-first explanations and hands-on work.
        I especially enjoy teaching climate science through computation: students learn the physics, then immediately
        test ideas by writing code and making figures.

        <!-- Course overview (verbatim, as requested) -->
        <p>
          Beginning with an introduction to past and present climate change, this course will delve into the radiative physics underlying the greenhouse effect.
          Students will code their own model of Earth’s energy balance in Python to demonstrate how greenhouse gases raise Earth’s equilibrium temperature.
          Armed with the physical intuition for anthropogenic climate change, we will discuss the more complex models composing the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) that are used to inform the IPCC reports.
          Working in teams, students will read research papers to create a final presentation on how the signal of climate change manifests itself on a particular component of the Earth system.
          By the end of this course, students will feel confident in their ability to discuss the science, nuance, and uncertainty associated with Earth’s changing climate.
